# Verification

While there is no gatekeeping on Versum, we do have a few mechanisms in place to guarantee that youâ€™re buying from a legitimate seller. It also allows us to filter out most botters, scammers, and copyminters.

There are three types of verification Versum: unverified, off-chain, and on-chain verification. Users registered with any of the Tezos identity managers can associate multiple claims to their profiles. The more claims you have, the higher your score. Above a certain score, you will unlock the off-chain status.

**Unverified users** don't have a profile set up with any of the Tezos identity managers ([Tezos Profiles](https://tzprofiles.com/), [TZKT](https://tzkt.io), [SUBJKT](https://hicetnunc.art), or [TezID](https://tezid.net/)). They will have some restrictions in place.<br/>

**Off-chain verified** is when the state of a user has enough claims associated with their profile. This process is automatic as we're constantly monitoring the above identity managers.<br/>

**On-chain verified** is when an off-chain verified user self-attests and signs their claims. This verification is required for users to mint. If the artist or seller specifies it, users will require this verification to interact with certain swaps, auctions, and offers.<br/>
